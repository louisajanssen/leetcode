# Steps to solve programming problems
1. Repeat the problem (make it known that you listened  )
2. Test cases (input output, many of them)
3. Propse and compare solutions (time and space complexity)
4. Choose a solution and implement it
5. Test solution (preferably interesting test case line by line before running code)
